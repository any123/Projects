Difference b/w DFS & BFS
DFS: 	it is memory efficient
	use stack
	more apllications like
	topological sort,finding cut vertices and bridges,finding stringly connected problems

BFS:	uses queue
	apllication like finding shortest path, or finding srtongly connected components

Hamilton graph=Travelling Salesman Problem=NP-Complete Problem

if the graph is hamilton graph then unique tological sorting exist for that graph.

Time Complexities

BFS=DFS=Topological sort=O(E+V)
Dijkstras  O(ELogV)  if we use max heap or priority_queue
Bellman Ford O(E.V)
Prims   O(ElogV)
Krushkal  O(ElogE)


Dijkstras= used to find the shortest distance from the source to any given vertices
Bellman Ford= used to find same as above even if the dges are of -ve weigth
Floyd-Wasrahl= shortest path from all source to all destination
  

		<TOPOLOGICAL SORTING>
All vertices of  0 degree are placed on queue. while the qeue is not empty, a vertex v is removed and all the edges adjacent to v have their indegrees 
decremented. a vertices is put on the queue as soon as its indegree fall to 0.
The topological  sort is the order in which the vertices r deqeue.
